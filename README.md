# Readme
This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a React project by pulling a Github repository. By following these steps, you will be able to clone an existing repository, install its dependencies, and run the project locally.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads \
Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/ \
Step 1: Clone the Repository
The first step is to clone the Github repository you want to work on. To do this, navigate to the repository's page on Github and click the "Clone or download" button. Then copy the URL provided.

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then run the following command:

### `git clone "https://github.com/Phantom168/MinutesManagementSystem.git"` `
This will create a new directory with the repository's name and download its contents.

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory by running:

### `cd MinutesManagementSystem`
Next, install the project's dependencies by running:

### `npm install`
This will install all the necessary packages and modules required for the project to run.

Step 3: Run the Project
Finally, to run the project locally, run the following command:

### `npm start`
This will start a development server that will automatically reload the page whenever you make changes to the code.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a React project by pulling a Github repository. Happy coding!


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
